1. You can subscribe on your friends with their username; and you will receive notifications before their birthdays. For that check _People_ page.;;;;
2. You can manage when you will get notifications by choosing subscription type. You can change type on any existed subscription. Also you can specify how many days before you need to receive notifications in _Settings_ page.;;;;;
3. If your subscription target doesn‚Äôt have Username; or in any other case; you can add subscription through joint chat with this person; this person shared himself to chat-calendar.;;
4. Even if your friend hasn‚Äôt Telegram or this bot; you can invite him; do it :) Or you can add note that doesn‚Äôt depend on specific user; but you still will be able to get notifications about it; and even choose subscription type.;
5. Except of subscription types settings you also can change your profile confidentiality; language or profile settings such as location or birthdate. ;;;;
